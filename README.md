                                              Fine-tuning a Chatbot with Hugging Face Transformers

                                                                      

Welcome to my chatbot fine-tuning project.

This repository demonstrates how to fine-tune a pretrained language model to create a simple chatbot that can answer specific questions using Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch.

Project Overview:
In this project, I built a custom dataset of user-bot dialogues focused on answering questions about a device called Spduino (e.g., Where is the Spduino located?). Then, I fine-tuned the Qwen1.5-0.5B-Chat, model to generate accurate and context-aware responses.

The process includes:  
o	Creating a dialogue dataset in JSON format  
o	Tokenizing the dataset with padding and truncation  
o	Setting up training arguments for efficient fine-tuning  
o	Using Hugging Faceâ€™s `Trainer` API to manage training loops and checkpoints  
o	Writing a function to generate chatbot responses from the fine-tuned model



Why This Project?

Fine-tuning pretrained models allows you to customize powerful AI systems for specific tasks with relatively small datasets. This project is a great example of building a chatbot tailored for a niche use case, learning practical NLP and model training techniques along the way.

How to Use:
1. Prepare your dataset: Customize or add dialogues in `data` format.  
2. Run training: Use the provided training script with Hugging Faceâ€™s Trainer.  
3. Generate responses: Use the generate_response() function to get replies from the chatbot.  


Tools & Libraries:
Python 3.8+  
Hugging Face Transformers (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/)  
Datasets (https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/)  
PyTorch  


What I Learned:

o	How to create and preprocess dialogue data for language model training  
o	The power of Hugging Faceâ€™s `Trainer` to simplify training workflows  
o	Fine-tuning causal language models for chatbot response generation  
o	Handling tokenization, padding, and label creation for language modeling  


Future Work:

o	Expand the dataset with more diverse dialogues  
o	Experiment with larger models or parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods  
o	Deploy the chatbot with a web or mobile interface  
o	Integrate conversational context for multi-turn dialogue
