# Fine-Tuning a Chatbot with Hugging Face Transformers

Welcome to my chatbot fine-tuning project!

This repository showcases how to adapt a pretrained language model to build a simple chatbot capable of answering specific questions. It leverages Hugging Face Transformers along with PyTorch to achieve this.

## Project Overview

In this project, I created a custom dataset of user-bot dialogues centered around queries about a device called **Spduino** (for example, "Where is the Spduino located?"). Using this data, I fine-tuned the **Qwen1.5-0.5B-Chat** model to generate precise, context-aware responses.

The workflow includes:
- Constructing a dialogue dataset in JSON format
- Tokenizing text with padding and truncation for uniform input
- Defining training parameters for effective fine-tuning
- Employing Hugging Faceâ€™s `Trainer` API to handle training cycles and checkpoints
- Writing a function to generate chatbot replies from the fine-tuned model

## Why This Project?

Fine-tuning pretrained models allows customization of powerful AI tools for specific tasks, even with small datasets. This project provides a hands-on example of building a chatbot designed for a specialized use case while gaining experience with NLP model training.

## How to Use

- **Prepare your dataset:** Add or customize dialogues as needed.
- **Train the model:** Run the training script using Hugging Faceâ€™s Trainer API.
- **Generate responses:** Use the provided function to get replies from your chatbot.

## Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.8+
- Hugging Face Transformers ([transformers documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/))
- Hugging Face Datasets ([datasets documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/))
- PyTorch

## What I Learned

- Creating and preprocessing dialogue data suitable for language model training
- Leveraging Hugging Faceâ€™s Trainer to streamline training workflows
- Fine-tuning causal language models for generating chatbot responses
- Managing tokenization, padding, and label creation effectively

## Future Plans

- Expand the dataset with more varied and complex dialogues
- Explore larger models or parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques
- Deploy the chatbot through web or mobile applications
- Enhance the model with multi-turn conversational context handling
